Suppose the vscode is intalled under Windows OS, then vscode can do many things:
* side by side editing any files, such as .py, .md, etc.
* multiple platforms or extensions, based on personal requirements:
  * Local code developing
  * WSL
  * Remote SSH connecting
  * Container/Docker
 * Git, synchronize the code to GitHub.
