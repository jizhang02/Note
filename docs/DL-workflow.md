### Prepare dataset
### Architecture
### Set up environment
☑️ CPU or GPU    
☑️ Epochs    
☑️ Learning rate    
### Training
☑️ Strategy 1: two-step pipeline. For instance, coarse segmentation (ROI detection) --> fine segmentation.    
👉Corresponding philosophical thoughts:    
☑️ Strategy 2: Compound loss functions. For instance, Dice+CE, Dice+Focal.    
👉Corresponding philosophical thoughts:
