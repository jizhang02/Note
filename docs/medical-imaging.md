### Prerequisite Knowledge
#### Mechanical waves

**Ultrasound** and **electromagnetic waves** are widely used in fields such as medicine and industry. Ultrasound can be used in medical diagnosis, non-destructive testing and other fields, such as echocardiography, ultrasound imaging, etc. Electromagnetic waves also have a wide range of applications, such as medical imaging, communication technology, radar and satellite communications. In medical imaging, electromagnetic waves include X-rays, CT scans, MRI and other technologies, all of which obtain image information by measuring the propagation and reflection of electromagnetic waves in the human body.

**Mechanical waves** refers to the wave formed by the change of physical quantity (such as pressure, density, displacement, etc.) in the propagation medium with time and space. They require a medium as a medium of transmission and thus can only travel in matter. Common mechanical waves include sound waves, water waves, and seismic waves.

#### Electromagnetic waves

**Electromagnetic waves** include waves of many frequencies and wavelengths.
* radio waves
* infrared
* visible light
* ultraviolet
* X-rays
* gamma rays

These waves have wavelengths ranging from hundreds of kilometers to the extremely short picometer. They are both forms of propagating energy resulting from the interaction of electric and magnetic fields. Electromagnetic waves of different frequencies have different uses and importance in nature and applications.

### Medical Imaging

#### X-Ray
X-rays are a type of **electromagnetic radiation** with high energy and short wavelength. They can pass through objects and be absorbed or scattered to form images on photosensitive film, phosphor screens or digital detectors. X-rays are commonly used in medical imaging, such as examining bones, internal organs, and soft tissue, and in industrial non-destructive inspection, such as inspecting metals, plastics, and food.

#### DSA 
Digital Subtraction Angiography

#### Ultrasound
Ultrasound imaging is a medical imaging technique that uses **high-frequency sound waves** to image human tissue. Ultrasound imaging can generate two-dimensional or three-dimensional images of the inside of the human body by sending sound waves into human tissue and receiving their echo signals, which can be used to detect disease or monitor organ function. Ultrasound imaging is commonly used to examine organs such as gynecology, liver, pancreas, heart, etc., because it is a non-invasive imaging technique that does not have radiation and is relatively safe.

During a conventional ultrasound examination, the doctor needs to stick the ultrasound probe tightly to the skin so that the ultrasound waves can be transmitted from under the skin and the echoes can be collected. However, the air between the skin and the probe can cause reflection and scattering of the ultrasound waves, degrading the image quality. Therefore, applying a layer of transparent glue (**ultrasound gel**) can eliminate the air between the skin and the probe, reduce the reflection and scattering of ultrasonic waves, and improve image quality. In addition, the glue can also increase the speed of ultrasound transmission, allowing the probe to detect deeper into tissues and organs, resulting in more accurate diagnostic results.

#### MRI

MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a medical imaging technique that uses **powerful magnetic fields and radio waves** to produce detailed images of the inside of the body. MRI images are produced by scanning the signals of water molecules in different parts of the inside of the body. The water molecules in the human body are made of hydrogen atoms, and the hydrogen atoms have a tiny spin that can generate a tiny magnetic field. Under the action of a strong magnetic field, these hydrogen atoms will rotate in the same direction or against the magnetic field, and radio waves will interfere with this rotation, making it produce a specific signal. Computers can generate high-resolution MRI images from these signals, which are used to diagnose diseases and monitor the effects of treatments.

In contrast to PET images, MRI images do not require the injection of a radioactive tracer. MRI uses powerful magnetic fields and harmless radio waves to produce images, and doesn't involve any radioactive substances. This makes MRI a non-invasive and safe imaging method. MRI is usually used to look at soft tissues (such as the brain, skeletal muscles, etc.) and internal organs (such as the heart, lungs, liver, etc.).

#### CT
CT (computed tomography) images are obtained through X-ray imaging technology, using a **rotating X-ray** source and corresponding detectors to scan the measured object, and then the obtained data is processed and reconstructed by a computer to generate a high-resolution, multi-dimensional image. Image with planar reconstruction and 3D reconstruction capabilities. CT images can be used to check various diseases, such as tumors, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, bone injuries, etc., and can also be used to assist radiotherapy treatment planning and surgical navigation. A CT image does not require the injection of a radioactive tracer, it uses X-rays for imaging, so no radioactive material is involved.

#### PET and SPECT

PET and SPECT are two nuclear medicine imaging techniques. They both use radioisotope-labeled radiopharmaceuticals or radiotracers to measure biological processes and generate images by detecting radioactive signals.

**PET** (Positron Emission Tomography) uses a radioactive tracer injected into the body during the radioactive decay process in the body. PET produces positrons through the decay of radioactive isotopes. **After the positrons and negative electrons meet, an annihilation reaction occurs and two gamma rays are released.** These two gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions and are measured by PET detectors.


**SPECT** (Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography) uses a radiopharmaceutical labeled with a radioisotope to image by emitting a single **photon**. The resolution of SPECT is low, but the imaging depth is large, and imaging can be performed in deep tissues. SPECT injects radioactive isotopes into patients, and **the radioactive isotopes naturally decay to release gamma rays.** These gamma rays pass through human tissues and are detected by SPECT cameras to form images.


#### μ-map
In SPECT imaging, μ-map is an image used for attenuation correction. It is generated by calculating the tissue density in CT images or MRI images. μ-map images show the linear absorption coefficient (μ-value) of the tissue and can be used for attenuation correction of SPECT images. Since μ-values vary from tissue to tissue, μ-map can be used to correct SPECT images more accurately, thus improving image quality.

## Medical Words

### Radionuclide

**68Ga** is a radioisotope with the chemical symbol Ga-68 and has a very short half-life of about 68 minutes. Because of its short half-life, it can be injected into the human body in a short period of time for medical imaging and diagnosis. In medical imaging, 68Ga is usually combined with a molecule called a ligand to form a compound called a radiotracer. These tracers can be injected into patients to detect and diagnose patient diseases, such as tumors and inflammation, through various imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET). Because 68Ga has a short half-life, it can only be prepared and injected shortly before use, making it a relatively safe radiotracer. 68Ga is a radioisotope with the chemical symbol Ga-68 and has a very short half-life of about 68 minutes.

**177Lu** is a radioisotope with the chemical symbol Lu-177 and has a long half-life of about 6.73 days. Because of its low radioactive energy, it can be used to treat some cancers, such as neuroendocrine tumors, prostate cancer, and lymphoma. 177Lu is commonly used in SPECT imaging because its gamma-ray energy range (113 keV and 208 keV) matches SPECT's energy-sensitive detectors. While PET can also detect these energies, the resolution of SPECT is better suited for this application.

**F18** stands for the radionuclide fluorine-18, a radioisotope used in medical imaging and molecular medicine research. f18 has a half-life of about 109 minutes and can be combined with a variety of biomolecules to form radiolabeled compounds, such as glucose (FDG) for PET scans to detect tumors and other diseases. f18 can also be be used for other radiolabeled compounds, such as fluorodeoxycholine (FCH) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDM).

The **radiotracer used in SPECT** technology typically has a long half-life and can therefore be imaged over a longer period of time, which makes SPECT technology well suited for the diagnosis and evaluation of diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurological and skeletal disorders. In addition, the relatively low cost of SPECT imaging allows the use of conventional radioisotopes and computer equipment for imaging, making it widely used in healthcare facilities.

The **radiotracer used in PET** technology usually has a shorter half-life and needs to be imaged in a shorter period of time, so PET imaging technology is more suitable for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of diseases, such as tumors and neurological diseases, etc. PET imaging technology has higher spatial resolution and sensitivity, which can provide more accurate molecular distribution information, and therefore is important for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of certain diseases. It is important for the diagnosis and monitoring of certain diseases.


**Monte Carlo Simulation**

**Dosimetry** is the science and technique used in radiation therapy to calculate and measure dose. Its main purpose is to determine the distribution and dose distribution of radioactive material in the patient's body in order to maximize the killing of tumor cells and minimize damage to healthy tissue during treatment.Dosimetry usually involves the use of measuring instruments to record the distribution and dose of radioactive material or the use of computational models to predict the distribution and dose of radioactive material in the body. Dosimetry is important in radiation therapy because it helps radiation oncologists and therapists determine treatment plans and ensure that patients receive safe and effective treatment.

**Biomarker** is a substance or indicator that can be measured in an organism or its derivatives and can be used as an indicator of a biological process or as a basis for disease diagnosis, prediction, or judgment of therapeutic effects. Biomarkers can be substances or indicators such as proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites, cells, tissues, etc., which can be detected by biological samples (e.g. blood, urine, tissues, etc.). Commonly used biomarkers include tumor markers, cardiovascular markers, inflammatory markers, metabolic markers, etc. Biomarkers have an important role in clinical medicine, and can be used for early diagnosis of diseases, classification and grading of diseases, selection and evaluation of treatment plans, and prognosis.
