68Ga is a radioisotope with the chemical symbol Ga-68 and has a very short half-life of about 68 minutes. Because of its short half-life, it can be injected into the human body in a short period of time for medical imaging and diagnosis. In medical imaging, 68Ga is usually combined with a molecule called a ligand to form a compound called a radiotracer. These tracers can be injected into patients to detect and diagnose patient diseases, such as tumors and inflammation, through various imaging techniques, such as positron emission tomography (PET). Because 68Ga has a short half-life, it can only be prepared and injected shortly before use, making it a relatively safe radiotracer. 68Ga is a radioisotope with the chemical symbol Ga-68 and has a very short half-life of about 68 minutes.

177Lu is a radioisotope with the chemical symbol Lu-177 and has a long half-life of about 6.73 days. Because of its low radioactive energy, it can be used to treat some cancers, such as neuroendocrine tumors, prostate cancer, and lymphoma.

177Lu is commonly used in SPECT imaging because its gamma-ray energy range (113 keV and 208 keV) matches SPECT's energy-sensitive detectors. While PET can also detect these energies, the resolution of SPECT is better suited for this application.

F18 stands for the radionuclide fluorine-18, a radioisotope used in medical imaging and molecular medicine research. f18 has a half-life of about 109 minutes and can be combined with a variety of biomolecules to form radiolabeled compounds, such as glucose (FDG) for PET scans to detect tumors and other diseases. f18 can also be be used for other radiolabeled compounds, such as fluorodeoxycholine (FCH) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDM).

### SPECT

The radiotracer used in SPECT technology typically has a long half-life and can therefore be imaged over a longer period of time, which makes SPECT technology well suited for the diagnosis and evaluation of diseases, such as cardiovascular, neurological and skeletal disorders. In addition, the relatively low cost of SPECT imaging allows the use of conventional radioisotopes and computer equipment for imaging, making it widely used in healthcare facilities.

The radiotracer used in PET technology usually has a shorter half-life and needs to be imaged in a shorter period of time, so PET imaging technology is more suitable for early diagnosis and treatment monitoring of diseases, such as tumors and neurological diseases, etc. PET imaging technology has higher spatial resolution and sensitivity, which can provide more accurate molecular distribution information, and therefore is important for the diagnosis and treatment monitoring of certain diseases. It is important for the diagnosis and monitoring of certain diseases.


### MRI

### μ-map
In SPECT imaging, μ-map is an image used for attenuation correction. It is generated by calculating the tissue density in CT images or MRI images. μ-map images show the linear absorption coefficient (μ-value) of the tissue and can be used for attenuation correction of SPECT images. Since μ-values vary from tissue to tissue, μ-map can be used to correct SPECT images more accurately, thus improving image quality.

### Monte Carlo Simulation

### Dosimetry
Dosimetry is the science and technique used in radiation therapy to calculate and measure dose. Its main purpose is to determine the distribution and dose distribution of radioactive material in the patient's body in order to maximize the killing of tumor cells and minimize damage to healthy tissue during treatment.Dosimetry usually involves the use of measuring instruments to record the distribution and dose of radioactive material or the use of computational models to predict the distribution and dose of radioactive material in the body. Dosimetry is important in radiation therapy because it helps radiation oncologists and therapists determine treatment plans and ensure that patients receive safe and effective treatment.

### Biomarker
Biomarker is a substance or indicator that can be measured in an organism or its derivatives and can be used as an indicator of a biological process or as a basis for disease diagnosis, prediction, or judgment of therapeutic effects. Biomarkers can be substances or indicators such as proteins, nucleic acids, metabolites, cells, tissues, etc., which can be detected by biological samples (e.g. blood, urine, tissues, etc.). Commonly used biomarkers include tumor markers, cardiovascular markers, inflammatory markers, metabolic markers, etc. Biomarkers have an important role in clinical medicine, and can be used for early diagnosis of diseases, classification and grading of diseases, selection and evaluation of treatment plans, and prognosis.
