## Install Singularity on WSL


#### Motivation
When we do high performance computing (HPC) on cluster, the corresponding running environment should also be uploaded. In the other words, the programs should work in a specific container.
Luckily, Singlularity is just doing this. It's a platform that can load various containers. 
Plus, Singularity is mainly used on Linux system. But personally I prefer to Windows system, in order to run programs on Linux, Windows Subsystem Linux (WSL) is a good choise.

Thus, this note records the installation of Singularity on WSL.

#### Installlation
* step 1: Install Singularity;
* step 2: Customize a container
